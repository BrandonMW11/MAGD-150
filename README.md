# MAGD-150
## A collection of files I made for my MAGD-150 course
#### Moving Squares
I chose this one becuase it's the first assignment where I learned something new.  That thing being how to make shapes move which ended up being a vital skill for every assignemnt since, including the final.

#### TV
This assignment represents my ambition.  More often than not, I wasn't satisfied with doing the bare minimun and I wanted to put my skills to the test.  No where did the requirements say I had to make three seprate images that had animation, but I decided that I should.

#### Sine and Camera
This is the assignment I struggled with the most since it took forever for me to figure out how sine waves worked.  However, I still remember the rush of excitemnt and satisfaction I got when I finally got everything to work and turned in the assignment.
